      <p>Behind the scenes at scout there is a huge server, capable of handling 600,000 users at once. Our database can now store 10TB of data, so the the chances of you finding a housemate have never been greater! After you create an account, your information is stored in our database. When another user creates a search, your information will be compared with their search paramaters. If there is a match then they will have the opportunity to send you a message request. You can then view their profile, and decide whether you would potentially like to live with them. Chat for a while! Get to know eachother! If all goes well then you have just Scouted yourself a housemate!
